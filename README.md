Develop an Android mobile phone app called IHearYou that
recognizes when the user audibly makes any of these
statements: “Blue” and “Red”. It appropriately responds
to the user: audibly by telling the user “Here is the blue screen” or “Here is the red screen”, and
visually by displaying a blue screen or by displaying a red screen (respectively).
